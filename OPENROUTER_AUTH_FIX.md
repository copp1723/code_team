# OpenRouter API Authentication Fix

## Issue Identified
The OpenRouter API is returning a 401 Unauthorized error with the message "No auth credentials found". The error details show:
- Status Code: 401 Unauthorized
- Error Message: "No auth credentials found"
- Auth Message: "Invalid JWT form. A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots."

## Root Cause
The API key in the `.env` file appears to be invalid or has been revoked. The current key (`sk-or-v1-d7e7ae87729d497392eba98d96a15e01`) is not being accepted by OpenRouter.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Get a Valid OpenRouter API Key
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/keys
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the entire key (it should start with `sk-or-v1-`)

### 2. Update the .env File
Replace the existing OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the `.env` file with your new key:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-new-api-key-here
```

### 3. Verify the Key Format
Ensure your API key:
- Starts with `sk-or-v1-`
- Is a single continuous string without spaces
- Has not been truncated or modified

### 4. Test the Connection
Run the test script to verify the connection:
```bash
node test-openrouter.js
```

### 5. Restart Services
After updating the API key, restart any running services:
```bash
# If running the web interface
npm run dev

# Or restart the server
node web-interface/server.js
```

## Alternative: Use Environment Variable
If you prefer not to store the key in the .env file, you can set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-new-api-key-here"
```

## Common Issues
1. **Expired Key**: OpenRouter keys may expire, requiring regeneration
2. **Rate Limits**: Free tier has rate limits that may cause authentication errors
3. **Account Issues**: Ensure your OpenRouter account is active and in good standing

## Testing
After updating the API key, the test script should show:
- Status Code: 200
- A successful response with the AI's reply
