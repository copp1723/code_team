# Web Interface Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Favicon 404 Error
- **Problem**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) :8080/favicon.ico:1`
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `favicon.svg` with a simple "M" logo
  - Added favicon link to `index.html`
  - Updated both `server.js` and `server-real.js` to serve the favicon

### 2. Default Repository Selection
- **Problem**: `rylie-seo-hub-v2` was pre-selected as the default repository
- **Solution**:
  - Removed default repository value in `index.html` (changed from `/Users/copp1723/Desktop/rylie-seo-hub-v2` to empty string)
  - Updated `server-real.js` to not have a default repository
  - Changed UI to show "None selected" when no repository is chosen

## Files Modified:
1. `web-interface/index.html` - Added favicon link, removed default repository
2. `web-interface/server.js` - Added favicon route handler
3. `web-interface/server-real.js` - Removed default repository, added favicon handler
4. `web-interface/favicon.svg` - Created new favicon file

## To Apply Changes:

Run the restart script:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/copp1723/Desktop/multi-agent-orchestrator/restart-web-interface.sh
/Users/copp1723/Desktop/multi-agent-orchestrator/restart-web-interface.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd /Users/copp1723/Desktop/multi-agent-orchestrator/web-interface
# Kill existing server
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
# Start server
./start.sh
```

## Testing:
1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Check that no favicon 404 error appears in console
3. Verify that no repository is selected by default
4. Select a repository from the dropdown to begin workflow

## Note:
The `real-integration-fix.js` file is already included in the HTML and will continue to work properly to show real results instead of simulated data.
