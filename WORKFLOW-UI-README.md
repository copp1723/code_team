# New Workflow UI - What We Built

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem You Had
- "Init All" and "Run Integration" were confusing
- Didn't know when to click what
- No clear workflow from start to finish
- Technical jargon everywhere

## âœ¨ The Solution: Workflow-Based UI

### Clear 4-Step Process:
1. **Upload Your Tasks** â†’ Drag & drop files
2. **Start AI Processing** â†’ One button to begin
3. **Watch Progress** â†’ Real-time updates
4. **Get Results** â†’ Download when done

### Key Features:
- **Left Panel**: Step-by-step workflow guide
- **Middle Panel**: Chat with AI assistant
- **Right Panel**: Live agent status & activity log

### How to Use:
1. Run: `./launch-workflow.sh`
2. Open: http://localhost:3001/workflow-ui.html
3. Follow the numbered steps

### What Each Part Does:
- **Upload Area**: Drop PDF/DOC/TXT files â†’ Creates tasks automatically
- **Start Button**: Activates AI agents to work on your tasks
- **Progress Tracker**: Shows each task being worked on
- **Chat**: Ask questions, get help, or redirect agents
- **Status Panel**: See which agent is doing what

### Integration:
- Connects to your existing backend automatically
- Falls back to simulation mode if backend is offline
- Real-time WebSocket updates when connected
- Works standalone for testing

## Files Created:
1. `workflow-ui.html` - The new interface
2. `workflow-integration.js` - Backend connection
3. `launch-workflow.sh` - Easy launcher

## To Switch Between UIs:
- Old UI: `./start-web.sh` â†’ Complex dashboard
- New UI: `./launch-workflow.sh` â†’ Simple workflow

The new UI guides you through the process naturally - no more guessing!
